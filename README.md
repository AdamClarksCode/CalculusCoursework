# CalculusCoursework
A C# program I wrote to brute force solve a piece of calculus coursework I was given. The coursework was to find the question that gave an answer of 1, where a straight line intercepted a parabola  in the positive quadrant. The area of 1 is the area between the parabola and the straight line. This program gives over 300 solutions, I only needed one for the coursework.
